Info
-----

The library provides `c` and `c++` api for the computation of the observables characteristics. 

The dependencies are described in the [effz][effz] program on github.

If the library is used in scientific publication we ask to provide the corresponding citation for the article 

	O D Skoromnik et al 2017 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 50 245007

During install of the library there is a usefull option. This is to specify the `--with-effz-home` variable in `configure`. This is a directory in which the python code and databases are stored. By default they are stored under `$HOME/.config/effz_lib`. So the option `--with-effz-home=prefix` overrides the standard path `$HOME/.config` to the one provided by `prefix`.
